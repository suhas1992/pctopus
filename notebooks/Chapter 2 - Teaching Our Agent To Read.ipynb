    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we built a simple QA agent that relied solely on its pre-trained knowledge. While impressive, it had a significant limitation - it couldn't access or understand your personal documents and files. It's like having a brilliant friend who can tell you everything about world history but can't read the document right in front of them!\n",
